AnimeSuki
=========

After many years it is finally time to breathe new life into AnimeSuki. AnimeSuki will be reborn as an open
anime, manga, light novel & game database. While it is not like there aren't enough anime databases out there already,
few if any allow you to incorporate their data and code into your own projects easily. It is this gap that
AnimeSuki will attempt to fill, in addition to other unique features & ideas.
